          <p class="text-justify"><b>Exchange in Canada </b>is for those students who do not leave the hustle and bustle aside and like to venture into extreme sports and have fun nights. Canada is a much younger nation than Brazil, but its community of Europeans is the largest in the entire world, and was formed about a thousand years ago in the far north of Newfoundland.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">From the 16th century onwards, the French began to colonize the site. In the 19th century, the colonies were unified and the lands became one country. At that time, English immigrants were also looking for a new life. Together, the French and English were able to take advantage of Canada's best natural attractions and elements of their own culture, making it an irresistible country for young people. Today, a tertiary industry nation, Canada attracts not only job seekers, but also tourists looking for beautiful landscapes and students attracted by prices lower than the world average, ease of obtaining student visas, high quality of life and by natural diversity.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><b>Studying in Canada</b> has become increasingly common for Brazilians who wish to study abroad, competing with destinations such as New York and others. Today, it is the third most sought after nation by Brazilians in exchange agencies for language courses and others. Canada offers paid work opportunities for those taking a technical course or higher, and students can take their English or French course and, at the same time, gain professional experience throughout the exchange. Sports such as hiking, swimming, rafting, abseiling and cycling, provided by the natural riches, are widely practiced in national parks, rapids and waterfalls. In addition, the beaches provide great surfing spots and the snow-capped mountains are excellent for skiing and snowboarding. The structure for the practice of these activities also stands out: anywhere you can hire experienced instructors and guides.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><b>Studying English or French in Canada</b> allows you to do ecotourism and enjoy all the structure that Canadian metropolises are prepared for young people. The influence of English culture is evident in the pubs and nightclubs located in major centers. French colonization also left its mark, especially with the cafes. Many of them are meeting points for university students. Discover Experimento's Exchange Program in Canada. With airline tickets always at good prices, the options for packages just for study and for those who want to pay during the period abroad are diverse, and we still have options for study with work to choose from!</p>
          <h2 class="mt-5">DEVELOPER IN CANADA</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">The IT area as a whole is very strong in Canada, and the trend is for this market to become even more heated, despite the pandemic, the country remains confident in this new year.</br>

            Currently, the technology industry has more than 488 thousand professionals from different areas of technology, among them the main positions are: project manager, data analyst, information security and developer. Therefore, the tip is to invest in this market.</p>
          <h3 class="text-justify"><b>Improve your skills as a developer</b></h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Learning to work with technology is getting easier. For example, nowadays there are a variety of online schools, which have fantastic dynamics and are very reasonably priced.

          </br>One way to understand this is that with about 25 Canadian dollars (about R$100.00 reais) per month it is possible to pay a monthly fee.
            
          </br>However, there is also another option, which is to do a College in Canada, which is like a technical course, focused on the job market and also counts points in the immigration process.</p>
